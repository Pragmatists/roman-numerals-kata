Roman Numerals
==================

### Part I
The Kata says you should write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals: eg

     1 --> I
     10 --> X
     7 --> VII
etc.

There is no need to be able to convert numbers larger than about 3000. 

Note that you can't write numerals like "IM" for 999. Wikipedia says: Modern Roman numerals ... are written by expressing each digit separately starting with the left most digit and skipping any digit with a value of zero. To see this in practice, consider the ... example of 1990. In Roman numerals 1990 is rendered: 1000=M, 900=CM, 90=XC; resulting in MCMXC. 2008 is written as 2000=MM, 8=VIII; or MMVIII.

### Part II

Write a function to convert in the other direction, ie numeral to digit
